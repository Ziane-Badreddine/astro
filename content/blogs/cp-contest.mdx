Game of Codes — Representing FST Settat at INSEA [#game-of-codes--representing-fst-settat-at-insea]


![Team Hmama Miyта at Game of Codes IV — INSEA](/blogs/goc.webp)
Proud to represent **Faculté des Sciences et Techniques de Settat — Université Hassan Premier** at the **4th edition of the Game of Codes Competitive Programming Contest** hosted at **INSEA** and organized by **INSEA Innovation Edge** 🚀

Our team of three — me, **Baidouri Khalil**, and **Ziane Badr Eddine** — took on the challenge under the unforgettable team name: ***"Hmama Miyта"*** (yes… long story 😄).

It was a great experience full of **problem-solving**, **teamwork**, **debugging under pressure**, and **lots of learning**.

<Callout type="info">
  Events like this remind us that competitive programming is not just about algorithms — it's about **collaboration**, **creativity**, and **enjoying the process**.

Big thanks to the organizers for such a well-run competition, and respect to all participating teams! 👏
